# iCap (Image-Captioner)

![](./src/others/sample.png "iCap")

_iCap is an image captioning tool that incorporates machine learning to derive captions for images uploaded to the application. This application leverages **Flask** for handling the back-end request processing and the **React** framework for a fulfilling front-end user experience._

## Getting Started

After cloning the project, enter the project's main directory (`image-captioner`) and type the following command in the terminal to download and enable multiple **npm** scripts execution in **Node**:

`npm install npm-run-all --save-dev`

The **Node** scripts in this project have been modified to download all **Python** and **Node** dependencies automatically. Type the following command in the terminal to download all dependencies:

`npm run dependencies`

Subsequently, to start the application, you can run the Flask and React servers simultaneously with the following command:

`npm run dev`

Now, you can upload images and acquire the captions generated by our machine-learning model.
